# Tunic Rainmeter Suite

This is a Rainmeter Suite themed around [TUNIC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/553420/TUNIC/). For more information regarding installation of Rainmeter or how to use it, please check out the [Official Rainmeter Website](https://www.rainmeter.net) or the [Official Rainmeter Discord](discord.gg/rainmeter).

## Skins

There are two skins that are a part of this suite (Clock and Dock). You can access some of the easily customizable settings for these skins in @Resources/Settings.inc. Of course, if you have knowledge with Rainmeter/Lua Scripting, feel free to make any changes you need.

### Clock



Just gives you time in 12h format. 



### Dock


Allows you to launch up to 6 different apps. Current version only allows exactly 6 apps (no more, no less). App names are displayed in Trunic, but upon hovering, it is deciphered into English.


## Settings

The @Resources/Settings.inc file allows you to make __some__ easy changes to the skins. These settings include, but are not limited to:

* Clock Size
* App names (both Trunic and English)
* Color when hovering over specific app
* File location to open when clicking on app
* Audio file to play when launching app
* Padding between apps in dock
